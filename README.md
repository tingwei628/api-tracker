> API = Antioxidant Protection Index
## Key Features & Technical Highlights

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Integration:** Processes **heterogeneous inputs** simultaneously, including uploaded **photos** (for visual ID), **Webcam OCR** (for nutrition labels), and **direct text** (for known portions).
2.  **Cumulative & Contextual Reasoning:** Calculates a **Grand Total API Score** by accumulating contributions from all sources. This score is then analyzed against the user's specific **activity/lifestyle goal** (e.g., marathon training, flu recovery) to determine targeted nutritional needs.

## Usage

1.  **Input Data:** Within the AI Studio interface, provide the necessary inputs:
    * Upload at least **two** files (e.g., one photo of your meal + one photo of a label via OCR).
    * Provide your **context** in the text box (e.g., "I just finished breakfast and I'm going for a 10k run soon.").
2.  **Analyze Output:** The model will return the three-section, ultra-concise report, providing your current API status and targeted action items.
